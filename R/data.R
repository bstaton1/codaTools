#' @format A [`mcmc.list`][coda::mcmc.list] object. The nodes stored in it include:
#'   * `B0`: intercept of logit-linear survival v. length relationship: global mean across years
#'   * `B1`: slope of logit-linear survival v. length relationship: global mean across years
#'   * `sig_B0`: standard deviation of between-year fluctuations in the survival intercept term
#'   * `sig_B1`: standard deviation of between-year fluctuations in the survival slope term
#'   * `b0[1:5]`: year-specific survival random intercepts
#'   * `b1[1:5]`: year-specific survival random slopes
#'   * `SIG[1:2,1:2]`: variance-covariance matrix modeling the covariance between random slopes and intercepts
#'   * `p[2:4]`: detection probability for each receiver array, assumed constant across years (note the first detection occasion is considered to be tagging, and so is omitted in the model)
#' @source Posterior samples generated from a model fitted to an entirely hypothetical data set.
#'   Suppose for 5 years, biologists individually tagged juvenile salmon in the headwaters of a river system
#'   before the fish made their migration out to sea. The length of each fish was measured as well,
#'   and it is safe to assume they are a random sample from the population and that they were all released
#'   at the same time within a given year.
#'   Three receiver arrays exist in the river that can detect fish as they move past them,
#'   but they are imperfect (sometimes a receiver will not detect a tagged fish passing it).
#'   The principle research goal is to quantify whether survival during migration
#'   is associated with fish size.
#'
#'   The object `cjs` (accessed via `data(cjs, package = "postpack"`)
#'   stores heavily thinned posterior samples (to reduce file size) from the model below, fitted with JAGS.
