Authors@R: person("Benjamin", "Staton", email = "statonbe@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Contains many shortcuts for querying, summarizing, plotting, and diagnosing particular
    nodes from an mcmc.list object. These objects are created from JAGS, BUGS, or STAN models,
    yet the author has found the default summary capabilities rather clunky for plotting and subsetting
    a particular portions of the posterior output.
