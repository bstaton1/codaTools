Title: Utilities for Dealing with mcmc.lists
Version: 0.1.2
Authors@R: person("Benjamin", "Staton", email = "statonbe@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Contains many shortcuts for subsetting, summarizing, plotting, and diagnosing particular
    nodes from an mcmc.list object. These objects are created from JAGS, BUGS, or STAN models,
    yet the author has found the default summary capabilities rather clunky for plotting and subsetting
    particular portions of the posterior output.
