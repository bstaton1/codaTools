Title: Utilities for Dealing with Posterior Samples Stored in mcmc.lists
Version: 0.1.17
Authors@R: person("Benjamin", "Staton", email = "statonbe@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Contains many shortcuts for subsetting, summarizing, plotting, and diagnosing particular
    nodes from an mcmc.list object. These objects are created from JAGS, BUGS, or STAN models,
    yet the author has found the default summarization and diagnostic capabilities rather clunky
    for plotting and subsetting particular portions of the posterior output.
    The attempt here is to standardize all work with MCMC output into \code{mcmc.list} objects, and to provide the
    infrastructure for a unified workflow. The functions in this package streamline the extraction,
    summarization, and diagnostics of particular nodes monitored after model fitting. Subsetting is made
    highly flexible by the incorporation of regular expression compatibility.
