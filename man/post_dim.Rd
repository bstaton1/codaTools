\title{Obtain MCMC dimensions from an mcmc.list}
\usage{
post_dim(post, types = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{post}{an object of class \code{mcmc.list}}

\item{types}{a character vector containing some of \code{"burn"}, \code{"post_burn"},
\code{"thin"}, \code{"chains"}, \code{"nodes"}. Defaults to \code{NULL}, in which case all of these are returned}
}
\value{
vector with named elements.
\itemize{
  \item \code{burn} - The burn-in period (per chain)
  \item \code{post_burn} - The post-burn-in period (per chain)
  \item \code{thin} - The thinning interval post-burn-in
  \item \code{chains} - The number of chains
  \item \code{saved} - The number of saved samples across all chains
  \item \code{params} - The number of nodes with MCMC samples
}

All of these will be returned if \code{types = NULL}, a subset can be returned by
 specifying (for example) \code{types = c("burn", "thin")}
}
\description{
Quickly query the number of burn-in samples, post-burnin, thinning,
number of chains, etc. from an object of class \code{mcmc.list}
}
\note{
If the \code{post} object was thinned after MCMC completed
  using \code{\link{post_thin}}, then the \code{burn} and \code{thin} dimensions will be improperly calculated.
